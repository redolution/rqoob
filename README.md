# rqoob

A replacement for qoob-flash.exe and GQoobPro.

## Why?

I needed a way to flash my Qoob Pro on Linux.
GQoobPro is old, and upon further inspection, the code is messy, hard to read,
and shows a lack of understanding of the protocol.
So I cracked open qoob-flash.exe with Binary Ninja and got to work.
This is the result.

## To do

rqoob was written primarily to fulfill my needs as the maintainer of gekkoboot.
Therefore, it currently doesn't have full feature parity with its predecessors.

See [open issues] for details. Contributions are welcome.
